## Description

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

## PWA Features
### Service Worker
The service worker caches assets for offline access and faster load times:
- Install: Caches essential files (HTML, JS, icons).
- Activate: Clears old caches to save storage.
- Fetch: Uses a cache-first strategy, serving cached files and fetching new ones as needed.

### Caching Strategy
Uses a Cache-First approach, loading assets from cache first for speed and offline access, with new files dynamically added to the cache during use.

### Web app Manifest
The manifest enables app installation with metadata such as:
- Icons: Device-optimized icons
- Theme/Background Colors: For a cohesive app-like feel
- Display Mode: Standalone mode for a native experience
- Shortcuts: Quick access to features like "Add Habit" and "Track Progress"
- And much more
